    "Recently developed tourism infrastructure, including ten-story hotels and neon-lit discos, is obscuring the moonlight, disorienting the female turtles as they seek out beaches to lay their eggs. Often the confusion leads them to assume that the hotel pools are the sea and they end up laying their eggs in the pool flowerbeds. Once the eggs hatch, the hatchlings are unable to find their way to the sea and die.

    "Ship Detection in Sentinel 2 Multi-Spectral Images with Self-Supervised Learning\n",
    "Automatic ship detection provides an essential function towards maritime domain aware­ ness for security or economic monitoring purposes. This work presents an approach for training a deep learning ship detector in Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images with few labeled examples. We design a network architecture for detecting ships with a backbone that can be pre-trained separately. By using self supervised learning, an emerging unsupervised training procedure, we learn good features on Sentinel-2 images, without requiring labeling, to initialize our network's backbone. The full net­ work is then fine-tuned to learn to detect ships in challenging settings. We evaluated this approach versus pre-training on ImageNet and versus a classical image processing pipeline. We examined the impact of variations in the self-supervised learning step and we show that in the few-shot learning setting self-supervised pre-training achieves better results than ImageNet pre-training. When enough training data are available , our self -supervised approach is as good as ImageNet pre-training . We conclude that a better design of the self-supervised task and bigger non-annotated dataset sizes can lead to surpassing ImageNet pre-training performance without any annotation costs.\n",
    "1.\tIntroduction\n",
    "Ship detection is an important challenge in economic intelligence and maritime secu­ rity, with applications in detecting piracy or illegal fishing and monitoring logistic chains. For now, cooperative transponders systems, such as AIS, provide ship detection and identification for maritime surveillance. However, some ships may have non-functioning transponders; many times they are turned off on purpose to hide ship movements. Mar­ itime patrols can help to identify suspect ships, but this requires many resources and their range is restricted. Therefore, using satellites, such as those from the European Space Agency Sentinel-2 mission, to detect ships in littoral regions is a promising solution thanks to their large swath and high revisit time.\n",
    "Some commercial satellite constellations offer very high resolution images (VHR) (<1 m/pixel) with low revisit time (1-2 days). However, VHR images are usually limited to the R, G, B bands and image analysis on such high resolution images is computationally intensive. On the other hand, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites can also be used, although their resolution is lower than VHR optical sources (e.g., Sentinel 1 has 5 m resolution), the analysis of their imagery is the main approach to ship detection since SAR images can be acquired irrespective of cloud cover and the day and night cycle. The downsides of SAR are low performance in rough sea conditions, but, most importantly, detection is only done on seas away from land and is not possible for moored ships in harbor or for ships smaller than 10 m [1]. Furthermore, SAR is vulnerable to jamming [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission of the European Space Agency offers free multi- spectral images with a refresh rate of maximum 5 days and a resolution down to 10 m, as detailed in Table 1. Our work focuses on this data source for several reasons. First, multi-spectral information allows to better extract a ship fingerprint and distinguish it from land or man-made structures, as shown in [3,4]. Second, a multi-spectral optical learning based approach can perform detection in both high seas and harbor contexts, while also removing the requirement of storing a vector map of coastlines and performing cloud removal as a pre-processing step. Thus, it could be adapted to a real-time, on-board satellite setting and is not affected by jamming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ship detection is a challenging task, ship identification in remote-sensing images is even more difficult [5]. A coarse identification could be made by ship type (container ship, fishing vessel, barge, cruiseliner, etc.) using supervised classification, with accuracy that should be closely related to image resolution. However, to establish ship identity uniquely, it does not seem feasible with the Sentinel-2 sensor to extract features fit for this purpose, such as measurement of ships to meter precision, extracting exact contours, or detecting salient unique traits of different ships. Our work focuses on detection but the approach is generic and could be extended to other sensors with better resolution, eventually allowing identification.\n",
    "Recent remote sensing approaches based on machine learning require large amounts of annotated data. Some efforts to collect and annotate data have been made for VHR images, for SAR and for Sentinel 2, but, for the latter, these works did not target ship detection in particular. For object detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN), an interesting way to overcome the lack of data is to use transfer learning. This is achieved either by using CNNs pretrained on large labeled data sets gathered in a sufficiently \"close\" domain (such as digital photographs), or by pretraining a neural network on the satellite image domain. The latter can be done through an unsupervised pipeline using self-supervised learning (SSL) [6], a contrastive learning paradigm that extracts useful patterns, learns invariances and disentangles causal factors in the training data. Features learned this way are better adapted for transfer learning of few-shot object detectors. We propose to use this paradigm to create a ship detector with few data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Globally, the results allow us to conclude that deep learning techniques achieve promising results. In all cases (close to shore and open-sea) recall is high, more than 75%. We obtained less than 0.14 false alerts per square kilometer in the open sea and close to the sea shore, the false alarm rate is around 1 ship/km2. Although the BL-NDWI baseline could be improved by finding more optimal NDWI thresholds for each image, the performance difference with respect to deep learning approaches seems hard to make up for.\n",
    "Networks trained with SSL achieve better results compared with ImageNet pretrained ones. In the few-shot setting, SSL pre-training is usually better and more stable. When sufficient examples are available SSL pretraining is as good as ImageNet or training from scratch. We notice also that performance increases with the size of the pre-training datasets. Since these are not annotated it is easy to build such datasets. The ones chosen here have no relation to the ship detection problem at hand, thus no significant effort is needed to select the images in these datasets.\n",
    "The pretext task needs to be chosen according to the downstream task in order to learn the needed invariances. The region based pretext task looks promising probably because it helps the encoder to better cluster together similar elements, such as water, agriculture crops, or residential areas, while a simple pretext task data-augmentation only focuses on color or noise invariances. The benefit of such pretext task can be seen in our case as it lowers the number of false positives over land and near the shore.\n",
    "In terms of computational complexity, the difference between all deep learning meth­ ods lies in the way we pre-train the weights. Compared to the supervised pipelines that can be used to train a ResNet-50 on ImageNet dataset, the self-supervised pipeline has a similar complexity but requires much larger batch size. This is particularly problematic for multi-spectral images, and a GPU with at least 8 Go of memory is necessary. The pretext task training is time-consuming: it took us nearly two days to train it on SEN12MS dataset using a multi-GPU machine (4 GPU with a total of 64 Go of memory). Training on a single desktop GPU with at least 8 Go of memory is feasible, but lasts longer.\n",
    "our image-based approach is still two orders of magnitude away from the false alert performance of methods applied on SAR images [1]. To improve image-based ship detection, a better network backbone could be studied, more adapted to small objects. Furthermore, it would be better to include cloud filtering and land/water classification explicitly in the network. Although adding more data is always a good idea, the few-shot setting is more challenging and can bring about more methodological improvements in deep learning for remote sensing.\n",
