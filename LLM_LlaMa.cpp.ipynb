       "' The correct answer is (E) Organized gangs are ignoring building restrictions.\\n\\nExplanation: From the passage, it can be inferred that new tourism infrastructure is being built without following regulations, and this is causing confusion among the turtles. This suggests that there are lax or non-existent regulations in place, which is equivalent to \"building restrictions\" being ignored by organized gangs. Therefore, option (E) is the best answer.\\n\\nOption (A) is incorrect because it is not mentioned in the passage that scarcity of turtles leads to an ecological imbalance in the sea.\\n\\nOption (B) is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that pool water chemicals are unsafe for turtles.\\n\\nOption (C) is incorrect because while moonlight may be important for turtle navigation, it is not the only source of light for them. The passage does not provide any information about the turtles\\' ability to navigate in other types of light.\\n\\nOption (D) is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that turtles are guided specifically by moonlight.

    "Recently developed tourism infrastructure, including ten-story hotels and neon-lit discos, is obscuring the moonlight, disorienting the female turtles as they seek out beaches to lay their eggs. Often the confusion leads them to assume that the hotel pools are the sea and they end up laying their eggs in the pool flowerbeds. Once the eggs hatch, the hatchlings are unable to find their way to the sea and die. The stringent building regulations that protected the turtles in the past are being flouted openly by organized criminals who either bribe or terrorize officials into turning a blind eye.\n",
