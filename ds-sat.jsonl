The Mask R-CNN model is based on the architecture of Resnet, which has proven to improve the performance of deep convolutional neural networks. Additionally, the Mask R-CNN model used in this article is pre-trained on the COCO dataset, which provides a good starting point for ship detection."}
{"question": "What are the possible reasons for the strong seasonality observed in the time series of vessel counts?", "answer": "The strong seasonality observed in the time series of vessel counts could be due to a couple of different reasons. Firstly, the activities of the port may be mainly touristic, leading to a larger flow of tourists in the summer. This increased tourist activity would result in higher maritime traffic during the summer months. Secondly, the weather conditions in the summer favor the acquisition of cleaner images with low cloudiness, allowing for a larger number of ships to be correctly detected. This means that more ships are likely to be observed and counted during the summer months compared to the winter months."}
